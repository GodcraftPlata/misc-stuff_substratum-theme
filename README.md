# Misc. Stuff
Hello there! I'm glad to say that I got as far as I wanted with this project. More features will be added, of course. Enjoy!

As for now, we got the following:

• WhatsApp overlay that changes the emojis within the app (only Unicode emojis option tho)

• Hello Moto bootanimation

• iOS Black bootanimation

• iOS Keyboard sounds (not working within substratum)

• iOS Lock-Unlock sounds

• Motorola old sounds

• Motorola new sounds

• Hide "Clear All" button on Lawnchair, Quickstep and OneUI launcher

• iOS Recents on Lawnchair (broken)

• MIUI, Oreo and Windows 10 Mobile navbars

• Windows 10 Mobile status bar

Another thing to note, I use master for everything. If something breaks there, I'll just fix it.

Lastly, if bootanimations or sound packs aren't being applied, go to the following link to apply them manually:
