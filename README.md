# misc-stuff_substratum-theme
Hello there. This theme is still a very early version of what I personally want it to be. There will be a lot of broken or unfinishedd stuff.

TL;DR: This theme is an alpha

Thanks to the substratum team for the template (https://github.com/substratum/template), pierx for the inspiration to make a little splash screen (even if it isn't working, like at all) and everyone who helped me (especially djdarkknight96, who taught me the basics)

As for now, we got the following:

• WhatsApp overlay that changes the emojis within the app

• Hello Moto bootanimation

• iOS Black bootanimation

• iOS Keyboard sounds (not working within substratum)

• iOS Lock-Unlock sounds

• Motorola old sounds

• Motorola new sounds

Another thing to note, I use master for stable stuff (everything should work) and alpha for... Well, ya know.

Lastly, if bootanimations or sound packs aren't being applied, go to the following link to apply them manually:
